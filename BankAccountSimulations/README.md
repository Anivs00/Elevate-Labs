# ðŸ’³ Bank Account Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
I built a **Java Bank Account Simulation** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage basic bank operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and interest calculation. The app uses Abstraction, Inheritance, and Method Overriding to simulate real-world banking behavior.

## ðŸ”¨ What I Did:
âœ… Created a text-based, menu-driven Bank Account Manager using Java.  
âœ… Used abstract classes and inheritance to handle Current and Savings accounts.  
âœ… Implemented method overriding for deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation.  
âœ… Applied proper polymorphism to manage accounts dynamically.  
âœ… Ensured input validation and clean menu navigation.

## ðŸš€ How to Run:
1. Compile the file:
```bash
javac Banking.java
```
2. Run the program:
```bash
java Banking
```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to create an account, deposit, withdraw, and view account details with interest.

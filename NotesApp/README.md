# ðŸ“’ Java Notes Manager

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
I built a **Java Notes Manager** using File I/O to create, save, and read notes from a text file. This project helps understand file handling concepts in Java using `FileWriter` and `FileReader`/`BufferedReader`.

## ðŸ”¨ What I Did
âœ… Developed a text-based Notes Manager using Java.  
âœ… Used `FileWriter` to write notes to a file in append mode.  
âœ… Used `BufferedReader` to read notes from the file.  
âœ… Handled exceptions using `try-catch` and `try-with-resources`.  
âœ… Provided a user-friendly menu to add and view notes.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open Terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the Java program:
```bash
javac NotesManager.java
```
3. Run the compiled program:
```bash
java NotesManager
```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to add or view notes.

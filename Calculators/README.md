# Elevate Labs - Java Console Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview
I built a **Java Console Calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations directly through the console. 
The calculator continuously accepts user input and processes calculations until the user decides to exit.

## 🔨 What I Did:
- ✅ Designed a menu-driven calculator using Java.
- ✅ Used `Scanner` to take user inputs for numbers and operations.
- ✅ Created separate logic for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- ✅ Implemented a loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
- ✅ Handled invalid choices and division by zero gracefully.
- ✅ Followed clean and easy-to-understand coding practices.

## ⚙️ Tools Used:
- Java (JDK)
- VS Code / Command Line
